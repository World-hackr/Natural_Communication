This project processes audio files (e.g., WAV, MP3) to generate corresponding visual representations. For each audio file, it produces:​

A PNG image visualizing the audio waveform.

An SVG file containing only the plot elements, excluding additional components like message number lines.​

Additionally, the project can transform audio waveforms into creative shapes, such as animals, providing a unique and engaging way to visualize sound.​

Features
Automated SVG Generation: For every audio file processed, an SVG file is generated containing only the plot, ensuring a clean and scalable vector graphic.

Creative Waveform Visualization: Transform audio waveforms into artistic shapes, such as animals, enhancing the visual appeal of the representations.

Seamless Integration: The SVG generation function integrates smoothly with the existing codebase without altering other functionalities.​

Usage
To process audio files and generate corresponding PNG and SVG files:​

bash
Copy
Edit
python your_script.py
Ensure that your audio files are located in the appropriate directory as expected by the script.​

Functionality
The script includes functions that:​

Iterate through audio files in the specified directory.

Extract the waveform data from each audio file.

Generate a PNG image visualizing the waveform.

Generate an SVG file containing only the plot, excluding other elements like message number lines.

Transform the waveform into creative shapes, such as animals, for enhanced visualization.​

These functions are designed to be modular and do not interfere with other parts of the codebase.​

Creative Visualizations
The project leverages audio processing and visualization libraries to transform standard waveforms into artistic representations. For instance, by analyzing the frequency and amplitude of the audio, the waveform can be morphed into shapes resembling animals or other objects, providing a unique perspective on the sound data.
